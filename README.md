<h1 align=center>Shoppers' Buddy</h1>

**Shoppers' Buddy** is a ***beacon-enabled app*** for malls to enhance the user experience of the customers as well as increase the brand awareness of the stores present at the mall. We aim to do this by installing beacons throughout the mall, and then by tracking the users' activity when they go around the mall. The app also has features for **parking assistance** and **personalised offers** for each customer. 

**Loyalty programs** are also possible with the app. Whenever a user goes into a store, the app will detect the beacon and log the visit by a person. Thus when the user visits a store multiple times, he is eligible for a discount. This incentivizes the customers to come more often. 

## Technologies used
- **Java (Android Studio)**
- **Firebase**
